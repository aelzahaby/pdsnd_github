# Explore Bikeshare US Data
This project explores the bikeshare data in three major cities in the US - Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I imported data using Pandas to try to solve some interesting questions using **descriptive statistics**.

## Files used
The files used in this project was:
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

## Software needed:
The software needed to complete this project was a text editor and the shoftware I chose was **Visual Studio Code**. However, you can use other text editors such as _Atom_ or _Sublime_. You will also need to install pandas, numpy, and Anaconda.

## Datasets
The data used in this project was provided by **Motivate**, which is a bikeshare system provider in the United states. I used a dataset that consisted of 6 months in 2017. The core columns used in this project were:
* Start Time
* End Time
* Trip Duration
* Start Station
* End Station
* User Type
* Gender
* Birth Year
It should be noted that Gender and Birth year were not in the **Washington** dataset.
